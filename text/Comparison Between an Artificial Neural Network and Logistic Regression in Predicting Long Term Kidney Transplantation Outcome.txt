1. Introduction

Predicting clinical outcome following a specific treatmentisa challenge that sees physicians and
researchers alike sharing the dream of acrystal ball to read into the future. In Medicine, several
tools have been developed for the prediction of outcomes following drug treatment and other
medical interventions. The standard approach fora binary outcome isto use logistic regression
(LR) [1,2] but over the past few years artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become an increas-
ingly popular alternative to LR analysis for prognostic and diagnostic classification in clinical
medicine [3]. The growing interest in ANNs has mainly been triggered by their ability to mimic
the learning processes of the human brain. The network operates in a feed-forward mode from
the input layerthrough the hidden layers to the output layer. Exactly what interactions aremod-
eled in the hidden layers is still under study. Each layer within the network is made up of com-
puting nodes with remarkable data processing abilities. Each node is connected to other nodes
of a previous layer through adaptable interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic
weights. ANNs are trained for specific applications through a learning process and knowledge
isusually retained asa set of connection weights [4]. The backpropagation algorithm and its var-
iants are leaming algorithms that are widely used in neural networks. With backpropagation,
the input data is repeatedly presented to the network. Each time, the output is compared to the
desired output and an error is computed. The error is then fed back through the network and
used to adjust the weights in such a way that with each iteration it gradually declines until the
neuralmodel produces the desired output.

ANNs have been successfully applied in the fields of mathematics, engineering, medicine,
economics, meteorology, psychology, neurology, and many others. Indeed, in medicine,
they offer a tantalizing alternative to multivariate analysis, although their role remains advi-

sory since no convincing evidence of any real progress in clinical prognosis has yet been
produced [5].

In the field ofnephrology, there are very few reports on the use of ANNs [6-10], most of which
describe their ability to individuate predictive factors of technique survival in peritoneal dialy-
sis patients as well as their application to prescription and monitoring of hemodialysis therapy,
analyis of factors influencing therapeutic efficacy in idiopathic membranousnephropathy, pre-
diction of survival after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder carcinoma and individual risk
for progression to end-stage renal failure inchronicnephropathies.

This all led up to the intriguing challenge of discovering whether ANNs were capable of
predicting the outcome of kidney transplantation after analyzing a series of clinical and im-
munogenetic variables.

2. The complex setting of kidney transplantation

Predicting the outcome of kidney transplantation is important in optimizing transplantation
parameters and modifying factors related to the recipient, donor and transplant procedure
[8]. The biggest obstacles to be overcome in organ transplantation are the risks of acute and
chronic immunologic rejection, especially when they entail loss of graft function despite ad-
justment of immunosuppressive therapy. Acute renal allograft rejection requires a rapid in-
crease in immunosuppression, but unfortunately, diagnosis in the early stages is often
difficult [11]. Blood tests may reveal an increase in serum creatinine but which cannot be
considered a specific sign of acute rejection since there are several causes of impaired renal
function that can lead to creatinine increase, including excessive levels of some immunosup-
pressive drugs. Also during ischemic damage, serum creatinine levels are elevated and so
provide no indication of rejection. Alternative approaches to the diagnosis of rejection are
fine needle aspiration and urine cytology, but the main approach remains histological as-
sessment of needle biopsy.[10] However, because the histological changes of acute rejection
develop gradually, the diagnosis can be extremely difficult or late [12]. Although allograft
biopsy is considered the gold standard, pathologists working in centres where this approach
is used early in the investigation of graft dysfunction, are often faced with a certain degree
of uncertainty about the diagnosis. In the past, the Banff classification of renal transplant
pathology provided a rational basis for grading of the severity of a variety of histological
features, including acute rejection. Unfortunately, the reproducibility of this system has
been questioned [13]. What we need is a simple prognostic tool capable of analyzing the
most relevant predictive variables of rejection in the setting of kidney transplantation.

3. The role of HLA-G in kidney transplantation outcome

Human Leukocyte Antigen G (HLA-G) represents a “non classic” HLA class I molecule,
highly expressed in trophoblast cells. [14] HLA-G plays a key role in embryo implantation
and pregnancy by contributing to maternal immune tolerance of the fetus and, more specifi-
cally, by protecting trophoblast cells from maternal natural killer (NK) cells through interac-
tion with their inhibitory KIR receptors. It has also been shown that HLA-G expression by
tumoral cells can contribute to an “escape” mechanism, inducing NK tolerance toward can-
cer cells in ovarian and breast carcinomas, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. [15] Additionally it would
seem that HLA-G molecules have a role in graft tolerance following hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. These molecules exert their immunotolerogenic function towards the main
effector cells involved in graft rejection through inhibition of NK and cytotoxic T lympho-
cyte (CTL)-mediated cytolysis and CD4+T-cell alloproliferation. [16]

HLA-G transcript generates 7 alternative messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) that encode
4 membrane-bound (HLA-GI, G2, G3, G4) and 3 soluble protein isoforms (HLA-G5, G6,
G7). Moreover, HLA-G allelic variants are characterized by a 14-basepair (bp) deletion-inser-

117
118 Artificial Neural Networks — Architectures and Applications

tion polymorphism located in the 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) of HLA-G. The presence of
the 14-bp insertion is known to generate an additional splice whereby 92 bases are removed
from the 3’UTR [28]. HLA-G mRNAs having the 92-base deletion are more stable than the
complete mRNA forms, and thus determine an increment in HLA-G expression. Therefore,
the 14-bp polymorphism is involved in the mechanisms controlling post-transcriptional reg-
ulation of HLA-G molecules

A crucial role has been attributed to the ability of these molecules to preserve graft function
from the insults caused by recipient alloreactive NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTL). [17] This is well supported by the numerous studies demonstrating that high HLA-G
plasma concentrations in heart, liver or kidney transplant patients is associated with better
graft survival [18-20].

Recent studies of association between the HLA-G +14-bp /-14-bp polymorphism and the
outcome of kidney transplantation have provided interesting, though not always concord-
ant results [21-22].

4. Kydney transplantation outcome

In one cohort, a total of 64 patients (20,4%) lost graft function. The patients were divid-
ed into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of HLA-G alleles exhibiting the
14-bp insertion polymorphism. The first group included 210 patients (66.9%) with either
HLA-G +14-bp/+14-bp or HLA-G -14/+14-bp whereas the second group included 104 ho-
mozygotes (33.1%) for the HLA-G -14-bp polymorphism. The patients had a median age
of 49 years (range 18-77) and were prevalently males (66.6%). The donors had a median
age of 47 years (range 15-75). Nearly all patients (94,9%) had been given a cadaver do-
nor kidney transplant and for most of them (91.7%) it was their first transplant. The
average (45D) number of mismatches was 3 + 1 antigens for HLA Class I and 1 + 0.7
antigens for HLA Class Il. Average +5D cold ischemia time (CIT) was 16 + 5.6 hours.
The percentage of patients hyperimmunized against HLA Class I and II antigens (PRA >
50%) was higher in the group of homozygotes for the HLA-G 14-bp deletion. Pre-trans-
plantation serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) were lower in the group of homozy-
gotes for the 14-bp deletion.

Kidney transplant outcome was evaluated by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum cre-
atinine and graft function tests. At one year after transplantation, a stronger progressive
decline of the estimated GFR, using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Dis-
ease (MDRD) study equation, was observed in the group of homozygotes for the HLA-
G 14-bp deletion in comparison with the group of heterozygotes for the 14-bp insertion.
This difference between the 2 groups became statistically significant at two years (5.3
ml/min/1.73 m2; P<0.01; 95% CI 1.2 -9.3) and continued to rise at 3 (10.4 ml/min/1.73m2;
P<0.0001; 95% CI 6.4-14.3) and 6 years (11.4 ml/min/1.73m2; P<0.0001; 95% CI 7.7 — 15.1)
after transplantation.

5. Logistic regression and neural network training

We compared the prognostic performance of ANNs versus LR for predicting rejection in
a group of 353 patients who underwent kidney transplantation. The following clinical
and immunogenetic parameters were considered: recipient gender, recipient age, donor
gender, donor age, patient/donor compatibility: class I (HLA-A, -B) mismatch (0-4), class
I] (HLA-DRB1 mismatch; positivity for anti-HLA Class I antibodies >50%; positivity for
anti-HLA Class II antibodies >50%; IL-10 pg/mL; first versus second transplant, antithy-
mocyte globulin (ATG) induction therapy; type of immunosoppressive therapy (rapamy-
cin, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, mycophenolate mophetyl, everolimus, tacrolimus); time
of cold ischemia, recipients homozygous/heterozygous for the 14-bp insertion (+14-bp/
+14-bp and +14-bp/-14-bp) and homozygous for the 14-bp deletion (-14-bp/-14-bp). Graft
survival was calculated from the date of transplantation to the date of irreversible graft
failure or graft loss or the date of the last follow up or death with a functioning graft.

ANNs have different architectures, which consequently require different types of algo-
rithms. The multilayer perceptron is the most popular network architecture in use today
(Figure 2). This type of network requires a desired output in order to learn. The network
is trained with historical data so that it can produce the correct output when the output
is unknown. Until the network is appropriately trained its responses will be random.
Finding appropriate architecture needs trial and error method and this is where back-
propagation steps in. Each single neuron is connected to the neurons of the previous lay-
er through adaptable synaptic weights. By adjusting the strengths of these connections,
ANNs can approximate a function that computes the proper output for a given input
pattern. The training data set includes a number of cases, each containing values for a
range of well-matched input and output variables. Once the input is propagated to the
output neuron, this neuron compares its activation with the expected training output.
The difference is treated as the error of the network which is then backpropagated
through the layers, from the output to the input layer, and the weights of each layer are
adjusted such that with each backpropagation cycle the network gets closer and closer to
producing the desired output [4]. We used the Neural Network Toolbox™ 6 of the soft-
ware Matlab® 2008, version 7.6 (MathWorks, inc.) to develop a three layer feed forward
neural network. [23]. The input layer of 15 neurons was represented by the 15 previous-
ly listed clinical and immunogenetic parameters. These input data were then processed
in the hidden layer (30 neurons). The output neuron predicted a number between 1 and
0 (goal), representing the event “Kidney rejection yes” [1] or “Kidney rejection no” (0),
respectively. For the training procedure, we applied the ‘on-line back-propagation’ meth-
od on 10 data sets of 300 patients previously analyzed by LR. The 10 test phases utilized
63 patients randomly extracted from the entire cohort and not used in the training
phase. Mean sensitivity (the ability of predicting rejection) and specificity (the ability of

predicting no-rejection) of data sets were determined and compared to LR. (Table 1)

6. Results and perspectives

ANNs can be considered a useful supportive tool in the prediction of kidney rejection fol-
lowing transplantation. The decision to perform analyses in this particular clinical setting
was motivated by the importance of optimizing transplantation parameters and modifying
factors related to the recipient, donor and transplant procedure. Another motivation was the
need for a simple prognostic tool capable of analyzing the relatively large number of immu-
nogenetic and other variables that have been shown to influence the outcome of transplanta-

tion. When comparing the prognostic performance of LR to ANN, the ability of predicting
kidney rejection (sensitivity) was 38% for LR versus 62% for ANN. The ability of predicting
no-rejection (specificity) was 68% for LR compared to 85% of ANN.

The advantage of ANNs over LR can theoretically be explained by their ability to evaluate
complex nonlinear relations among variables. By contrast, ANNs have been faulted for be-
ing unable to assess the relative importance of the single variables while LR determines a
relative risk for each variable. In many ways, these two approaches are complementary and
their combined use should considerably improve the clinical decision-making process and
prognosis of kidney transplantation.
